# C-Projects
* Collection of projects written for APS105 - Computer Fundamentals in C

## Lab 1
* Performs basic math operations such as calculating product, difference and sum of the square roots

## Lab 2
* Calculates the cost of making a purchase on credit and paying the money off after N months using the formula:
        ![Formula](https://github.com/VardhanYash/C-Projects/blob/master/L2-Interest%20Rate%20Cost/Capture.PNG)
        
        * P is cost of Item
        * r is the interest rate per month
        * N is the number of months over which the item is paid for

## Lab 3
* Helps with the budgeting of coffee based on a loyalty program
* Accepts as input : price of coffe, how many coupons to redeem free coffee, how much money the user has to spend on coffee this month
* Output the # of coffees they can purchase this month, number of additional coffees they can reedem via coupons, amount of money and coupons left over at the end of the month, and average price the user spent on coffee (taking into account the free coffees)

## Lab 4
* Calculates the Riemann sum for the function: f(x) = 2x^2 - 7x - 2
* User inputs left boundary, right boundary and number of rectangles

## Lab 5 Part 1
* Reads in a positive number with at least 6 digits and then encrypted
* Encryption is done my adding 4 to each digit of the number (if > 9 then sub 10), next each digit is shifted to the left by one place and the most significant digit wraps around to become the least significant

## Lab 5 Part 2
* Implementing the game of craps
       
       * The game of craps is played with two dice.  On the first roll, the player wins if the sumof the dice is 7 or 11.  The player         
       * loses if the sum is 2, 3, or 12.  Any other roll is called a “point” and the game continues. On each subsequent roll, the              
       * player wins if he or she rolls the point again. The player loses by rolling 7. Any other roll is ignored and the game                  
       * continues.  At the end of the game the user has a choice to start a new game by pressing y or Y. Pressing any other key will          
       * display the number of wins and losses and then exit the program
        
## Lab 5 Part 3
* Implements Zeller's Algorithm to calculate the day of the week on which a given date will fall or fell in the past.
